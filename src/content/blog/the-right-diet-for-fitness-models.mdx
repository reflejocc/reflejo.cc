                If you've ever wondered whether you could become a commercial model, the answer is a resounding yes! Let's explore what it takes to embark on this exciting career path.
        </div>
        <p class="content-text">The world of commercial modeling opens up a myriad of opportunities for individuals from all walks of life. Unlike high fashion modeling, which often has strict requirements regarding height, weight, and age, commercial modeling is more diverse and inclusive. It invites people of various shapes, sizes, ages, and ethnicities to participate in a wide array of advertising campaigns.</p>
        <h2 class="content-title m">What is a Commercial Model?</h2>

        <p class="content-text">
            A commercial model is someone who is hired to advertise products or services in commercial campaigns. This can include print advertisements, television commercials, online ads, and more. The primary goal of a commercial model is to appeal to a broad audience and convey a relatable, everyday image. This type of modeling is less about the model's personal style and more about their ability to represent the target demographic of the product.
