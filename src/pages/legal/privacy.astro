              <p>
                At REFLEJO, we respect your privacy and are committed to being transparent about how we handle information.
                This website is designed for showcasing our photography and video work, and we collect minimal data necessary
                to improve the experience.
              </p>

              <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
              <p>
                We do not directly collect personal information from visitors. However, we may use third-party tools like
                Google Analytics to understand general traffic and usage patterns. These tools may collect anonymized data such as
                your IP address, browser type, and time spent on the site. This data helps us improve performance and content.
              </p>

              <h2>Social Media and External Links</h2>
              <p>
                Our website includes links to social media platforms (e.g., Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, etc.). When you
                visit these platforms, their own privacy policies and data practices apply. We encourage you to review
                their privacy statements before interacting with our pages.
              </p>

              <h2>Cookies</h2>

                settings. Disabling cookies may limit certain site functionality but will not prevent access to our content.
              </p>

              <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
              <p>
                We do not sell, rent, or share personal data with third parties. Data collected through analytics is
                aggregated and used only to improve our siteâ€™s design and user experience.
